My journey began in the trenches of finance, where I honed my skills in credit risk modelling and data science at Street UK Foundation in Birmingham. I architected full Azure data stack solutions, led advanced analytics efforts, and revitalised credit risk modelling methodologies with innovative approaches, earning recognition from senior management and trustees alike.
Eager to expand my horizons, I joined BINK, Ascot, where I spearheaded the creation of agile data pipelines and led the development of a robust Snowflake Data Warehouse solution. Collaborating with cross-functional teams, I've presented actionable insights to stakeholders, automated data testing, and introduced cutting-edge development standards within the data team.
